      <h1>NeuralPrivacy.org — Concept Note 1.0</h1>
      <p class="muted">
        This document is a non-binding concept note. It outlines how <b>NeuralPrivacy.org</b> can be used as a global, neutral banner for neural data and mental privacy governance — without describing or implying any existing operational service.
      </p>

      <h2>0. Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of NeuralPrivacy.org is to provide a simple, institution-grade name around which organisations can structure
        charters, observatories, indices or programmes dedicated to <b>neural privacy</b>, mental privacy and cognitive liberty.
        The domain is descriptive and neutral: it is not a product brand, but a shared label that can host norms, principles and
        evidence.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Why “Neural Privacy” now?</h2>
      <p>
        Over the next decade, AI, neurotechnology and brain–computer interfaces will make neural activity legible to machines.
        Neural signals will no longer be confined to clinical settings; they will increasingly inform research, consumer devices,
        workplace tools and defence applications. As soon as neural data can be recorded, analysed and monetised, traditional
        privacy law becomes insufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dedicated language is emerging around <b>neural data</b>, <b>mental privacy</b> and <b>neuro-rights</b>. Legislators, regulators,
        NGOs and research communities need a focal point to bring these conversations together. NeuralPrivacy.org can serve as
        that focal point: a stable name that points to the protection of the mind in a data-driven world.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Roles NeuralPrivacy.org can play</h2>
      <p class="muted">Examples are illustrative only; they do not bind the buyer nor the seller.</p>
      <h3>2.1 Global charter / framework</h3>
      <p>
        NeuralPrivacy.org can host a voluntary framework setting out principles for the collection, processing and use of neural
        data. The emphasis is on human rights, mental integrity, transparency and limits on inference or manipulation. Tech
        companies, BCI manufacturers, AI platforms and public bodies could sign or reference the framework as part of their
        governance.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Observatory & index</h3>
      <p>
        A second role is that of an <b>observatory</b> tracking laws, guidelines, case law and enforcement actions related to neural
        data. From this work, an index or scorecard could be derived — comparing jurisdictions, sectors or organisations on how
        they protect mental privacy and neural data.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Resource hub for regulators & civil society</h3>
      <p>
        NeuralPrivacy.org can also act as a curated hub pointing to academic work, NGO reports, technical standards and policy
        recommendations. The objective is not to replace existing institutions, but to give them a coherent entry point into this
        emerging field.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Programme banner for a foundation or alliance</h3>
      <p>
        Foundations, philanthropies or multi-stakeholder alliances may use NeuralPrivacy.org as the banner for a programme on
        “Neural Privacy & Human Rights”. Grants, research calls, advocacy campaigns and public engagement efforts could all be
        hosted under this umbrella without needing to create a separate, less intuitive brand.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Positioning vs. related concepts & assets</h2>
      <p>
        NeuralPrivacy.org focuses on the <b>protection of neural data and mental states</b>. It sits naturally alongside, but distinct
        from, other governance concepts such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><b>BCI safety & access</b> (e.g. safety, risk and consent frameworks for brain–computer interfaces),</li>
        <li><b>Genetic sovereignty</b> and control over genomic resources,</li>
        <li><b>Digital / compute sovereignty</b> and control over critical infrastructure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An acquiring organisation may choose to articulate NeuralPrivacy.org with adjacent initiatives on BCI governance, AI
        safety, data protection, human rights or neuroscience, but there is no obligation to do so.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Governance & operating model (to be defined by the buyer)</h2>
      <p>
        This concept note deliberately leaves governance choices open. Depending on the buyer’s mandate, NeuralPrivacy.org
        could be:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>a programme inside an existing organisation (foundation, NGO, multilateral body),</li>
        <li>a dedicated non-profit entity coordinating an alliance,</li>
        <li>a light-weight observatory relying on a distributed expert network,</li>
        <li>a purely informational site signposting key resources and initiatives.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In all cases, the domain provides continuity: even if structures change over time, NeuralPrivacy.org remains the stable
        banner under which the work is recognised.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Safety, neutrality & legal notes</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The following points summarise the safety posture associated with the domain as transferred.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>The seller transfers the <b>domain name only</b>; no services, databases or software are included.</li>
        <li>No neural, health or personal data is collected, stored or processed by the seller via NeuralPrivacy.org.</li>
        <li>No clinical, psychological, diagnostic or neurotechnological service is offered.</li>
        <li>No individual legal, medical or financial advice is provided.</li>
        <li>The buyer remains fully responsible for regulatory, ethical and legal compliance of any future activity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Next steps for interested organisations</h2>
      <p>
        Organisations that see NeuralPrivacy.org as a relevant banner for their mission can:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>start with a confidential discussion under NDA,</li>
        <li>map how the domain could integrate with existing strategies on AI, neurotech and human rights,</li>
        <li>define a phased roadmap (e.g. resource hub → observatory → charter or index),</li>
        <li>use an escrow service and a digital asset transfer agreement to secure the acquisition.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The intention is simple: provide a name that helps protect the most intimate frontier of privacy — the human mind —
        while remaining strictly neutral and descriptive.
